# EPKFarm v1

EPKFarm v1 will be deployed in BSC. EPK holders can add liquidity to BSC-EPK/USDT pairing in Pancake to get the LP token and stake the LP token in EPKFarm to get EPK airdrop. The rule of airdrop in EPKFarm v1 is simple. The more LP token you stake, the more EPK you will get. Your EPK reward and your staked LP token are linearly related.
